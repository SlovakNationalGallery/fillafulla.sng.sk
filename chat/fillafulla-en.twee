You could say that there’s something of Munch in it, maybe his <a href="https://www.edvardmunch.org/self-portrait-with-cigarette.jsp" target="_blank">Self-portrait with a cigarette </a>. In Prague, I saw the Munch exhibition one year earlier, in 1905.

I was born in Ružomberok, February 27th, 1902. Very early on, I fell ill, and so that I wouldn’t be bored, my mother bought me a small palette with little knobs of paint. And so I licked my finger and wiped it on the other side of the palette, and then somehow drew my first human figure.

All I can say with certainty is that even though we never met in person, I knew Emil’s work… we shared the same interest in modern art… When I saw on display one of Emil’s paintings, where he sliced through realism like a saw through dry wood, the expressions on our faces quenched the smiles of the incorrigible reactionaries.

This was when all of the currents in modern art were coming into force… the old petty-bourgeois art was dying and we just happened to be there. I’d say that this influenced us, and indicated where our artistic paths would lead....

[[Was there some moment when this change manifested?->EF-010]]

:: EF-010 [speaker-filla]
In the Kinský Gardens in 1905, there was an exhibition by Edvard Munch, which led me to join with my friends and form the “Eight”. Edvard Munch was also the inspiration for my early Expressionist painting “Reader of Dostoyevsky”, which in time became quite the subject of discussion.

This is what I wrote in Volné směry (the artistic journal of the Mánes Artists’ Alliance): “The work of Munch went off like a firecracker in our hearts… All of our desires, loves and hopes were at once realised, we were in a state of permanent excitement … because we saw in him a guardian angel of our future path and the one to bless our resolution to become artists of today. We thought and felt that Munch had arrived for us alone”.

Never did we speak unnecessarily, and perhaps because of this we understood each other so well. Even then, we were matching ourselves against all of the art styles that were then springing up. 

[[Who were your artistic inspirations?->LF-013]]

:: LF-013 [speaker-fulla]
My inspiration? A hard question to answer. There was the entire spectrum of modern French art, names like Braque, Matisse, Picasso, Rouault... all the names that stood for absolute creative freedom. At certain points, I was also inspired by Kandinsky, Klee or Chagall, yet for much of what had the strongest influence on my artistic development, the specific artist was not that important. I’m thinking, for instance, about medieval art or children’s drawings.

[[How did it take place?->LF-IMG-004]]
[[And what about you, Mr Filla?->EF-013]]

:: LF-013B [speaker-fulla]
Hard to say. I always tried to combine diverging influences as freely as I could. In earlier years, I was most impressed by the personalities of modern French art who stood for absolute creative freedom – names like Braque, Matisse, Picasso, Rouault...

One day, I saw in the newspaper an article about a Czech resistance organisation headed by Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk – the “Maffia”.

It was a secret organisation for Czechoslovak independence during World War I. Its main areas were espionage and conspiratorial activities.

Even before the war broke out, when it could already be felt in the air, my friends and I discussed how the conflict could be a unique chance to free our nation from the chains of the monarchy. I, though, unlike several of them felt that we, as a nation, were not yet ready for war. But any efforts for autonomy I’d try to support however I could. An independent Czechoslovakia, it was believed, could also form a counterweight to Germany and Hungary, which then occupied much of the territory where our fellow citizens lived.

Slovakia, I thought, was part of our shared country, and Slovaks were an important part of the Czechoslovak nation. Even as a student, I hiked through almost the whole Moravian-Slovakian borderlands, and also traversed much of Slovakia then under Hungarian rule. I was impressed by Slovakia’s landscapes and traditions, and thought and wrote much about them.

Slovakia’s landscapes and their traditions really are an inexhaustible source of artistic inspiration. It’s enough to walk through just one region of many and you’ll have enough to paint for several weeks to come.

We moved to Amsterdam, and I painted a lot, mostly Cubist still-lifes. After the declaration of an independent Czechoslovakia, I also helped to organise the Czechoslovak embassy in The Hague. Shortly after the war, we returned to Czechoslovakia, and I served for a brief time at the Foreign Ministry, but very soon I gave it up and turned primarily to painting.

If an ordinary Slovak walked into our studio and saw our works, he’d usually clutch his head in his hands in horror, run out onto the staircase without a word, and usually not even stop until the end of the street. The Slovak spirit then still remained in its sweet rest, in the outlived folklore.

Unfortunately, our efforts came up against the barriers of contemporary taste. The daily press took no interest in our publication, at the most we were accused of snobbery. We were at least backed up by Josef Vydra. He even wrote a piece for the third issue where he appealed to the young generation of artists not to remain caught in mediocrity.

In the painting “Song and Labour”, I wanted to celebrate Slovak national traditions and folklore, but without the nationalist pathos that was back then somewhat of a fashion. They even wrote about us that we were not national enough, in the same way that Manet and Cézanne were not French enough.

We were given picks to dig shafts for the huge concrete pipes that were intended to bring water into the arms factory. At the time, I was 58... and, for instance, Josef Čapek was 57. It was all too clear that we couldn’t survive the coming winter… but then along came Hugo Rokyta, one of the Czech prisoners, with an idea that saved us.

[[Akou?->EF-042]]

:: EF-042 [speaker-filla]
He worked in the camp as an interpreter between the German officers and the Czech prisoners. He proposed to General Koch of the SS that we could, as artists, illustrate Aryan ancestry certificates for the SS officers… and he readily agreed.

Our lives were no different from the other prisoners: the same military drill, the same terrible conditions, but with one difference: as we searched for the ancestors of our SS tyrants, right under their murderous gaze, we were freed from the pains of slave labour… and this saved our lives. It was then that I secretly started to write. 

[[What did you write about?->EF-044]]
[[Did it help you to survive?->EF-044B]]

:: EF-044 [speaker-filla]
Essays about art, and also philosophical texts about freedom… these are the fruit of 2000 long, cruel nights, when instead of sleep and dreams I remained half-poised between waking and dreaming, and the most convoluted ideas arose in me… I wrote them down so I simply wouldn’t die. Perhaps even today, to read from these chapters could have the same purpose and the same effect.

[[Did your writing help you to survive?->EF-044B]]
[[How did it all turn out?->EF-IMG-019]]

:: EF-044B [speaker-filla]
I survived only barely, with scars on my body and on my soul. Of course, there had to be a huge measure of luck in this. Josef Čapek didn’t have the same luck, he died of typhus only shortly before liberation.

No one could avoid these unwanted “attentions”. In the form of Communist Party directives, I was given a “recommendation” to only produce work of a decorative character. But then there appeared an offer that brought me to the eyes of the world, even across the sealed border and the Iron Curtain.

For my seventieth birthday, I prepared for the Mánes Gallery in Prague an exhibition from my series “Songs”, but on June 21st 1951 I was invited for this “discussion”. In fact, it was more like a court hearing. I had to meet with a committee set up from members of the Third Regional Centre of the Union of Czech Artists, who provided their views on the exhibit.

[[What was the problem?->EF-063B]]
[[How did it turn out?->EF-THREAD-004]]

:: EF-063B [speaker-filla]
At the start, they pretended to be highly respectful, but soon it became clear that “Songs” was not of their liking. It was, they said, ugly, gloomy, not in a technique “from our traditions”, and also the paintings were not realistic enough, not heroic, and other similar complaints. This was the classic line of the Communists: dogmatism masked by polite phrases, and arguments that on closer examination turned out to be utter nonsense. In the end, they prohibited the exhibition of any work of mine except for the landscapes of the Central Bohemian Mountains.

My seventh myocardial infarction spelled the end. Up to my last breath, I struggled for what had been the goal of my entire life. Freedom!

Emil’s death brought to an end the period of parallels in our lives. Because of this, it’s time for us to end as well.

Hana donated part of my oeuvre to the state… my later body of work is owned now by the Benedikt Rejt Gallery in Louny. In the Peruc chateau, there is now a memorial room.

After my wife Klárika died, I gave all of my artworks to the state as well, and returned to Ružomberok. In 1963, I was awarded the title of “national artist”, and on my old father’s land a gallery was built. There was an appartment for me in the building.

Here’s where it started, and here’s where it ended. During my last years, I worked in my “personal museum”.

I’d say that you were on exhibit while you were still alive – even though it was in your own gallery.

[[Are you pleased with how the building turned out?->LF-078B]]
[[To wrap this up, do you have some final message?->EF-073]]

:: LF-078B [speaker-fulla]
The construction of the gallery took seven long, exhausting years. In spite of the small defects in its aesthetics, I would consider it more or less, if you overlook some details, a relatively successful work of architecture.

[[Do you have anything to say in conclusion?->EF-073]]

:: EF-073 [speaker-filla]
It’s possible to kill art, but it’s not possible to live without art. Through art, freedom comes into being, and there is no freedom outside of a free person.

Pictures should exist to please the viewer. Optimism in art supports the building of a new, more joyful life. The joy of colour is the artistic manifestation of this aim – and my work always focused on it as a goal. 

[[Thank you for such a pleasant discussion.->EF-074]]

Thank you as well, it was a pleasure to speak with you.
